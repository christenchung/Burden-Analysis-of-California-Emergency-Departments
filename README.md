# sql/tableau projects

By utilizing databases relating to healthcare and public health, I am able to meld my passion for medicine with developing skills in data analysis and visualization. I employ SQL to better understand and connect data, while conveying these relationships through visualization on Tableau to promote data-backed decision making.
