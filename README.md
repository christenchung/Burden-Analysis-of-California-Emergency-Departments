# Burden Analysis of California Emergency Departments/Rooms 2021-2023

## Project Backgroud

Fortunately, ERs in the United States treat all patients regardless of insurance or payment. ERs are crucial in caring for all patients, including those who are otherwise unable to seek timely care. However, this inevitably places strain on ERs due to limited treatment stations and resources. Using ER data from California Health and Human Services, I analyze statewide ER burden with particular aim to guide decision making of resource allocation and health disparity. 

## Executive Summary 

Analysis of 12,000+ records from 2021-2023 demonstrates that California ERs are facing increasing burden (quantified as visits per treatment beds). ER beds and resources are unable to support the increasing number of patient visits. Burden is especially exacerbated in non-profit hospitals and in areas with health care shortages. Top counties facing increasing burden include Los Angeles, San Bernardino, San Diego, Alameda, Santa Clara, San Joaquin, Fresno, Kern, Sacramento, Monterey, Ventura, Sonoma, and Contra Costa. Hypertension, diabetes, mental health, and substance abuse are the leading contributors to ER burden despite not being emergent. Ironically, the lowest contributors of ER burden are emergent such as respiratory, sepsis, stroke, and cardiac diagnoses. 
Therefore, there is significant demand for healthcare services and supporting services amongst California non-profit ERs within these counties. Addressing aforementioned chronic diseases can ameliorate ER and economic burden.

## Insights

#### Burden Trends 
* There was a yearly average of 9,994,676 visits and 7,202 treatmend beds 
* In just 2 years, ER burden increased by 17%. While ER visits increased by 22%, ER beds only had a net increase of 7%. In 2023, beds decreased by 1% and ER count decreased by 2%.  
* Non-profit ERs face the most burden while government ERs face the least.
* Of the top 25% burdened ERs, half are in areas with health care shortages. This increased in 2023.

#### Burden by Disease  
* Chronic factors contribute to highest ER burden, such as hypertension, diabetes, mental health, substance abuse, active COVID-19, homeless, and obesity.
* Emergent diseases contribute the least burden and include respiratory, sepsis, stroke, and cardiac

#### Regional Hotspots  
* Los Angeles County ERs experience the most burden, with the most consecutively burdened ERs each year.
