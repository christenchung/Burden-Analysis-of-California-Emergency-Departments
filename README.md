# Burden Analysis of California Emergency Departments/Rooms 2021-2023

## Project Backgroud

By law, ERs fortunately treat all patients, regardless of insurance or payment. ERs are crucial in coordinating emergent care to all patients that truly need it. However, this inevitably places strain on ERs due to limited treatment stations and resources. Using ER data from California Health and Human Services, I analyze statewide ER burden with particular aim to promote data driven decision making in regards to resource allocation and health disparity

## Exectuvie Summary 

California Health and Human Services data from 2021-2023 demonstrates that California ERs are facing increasing burden, or increasing visits per treatment beds. Burden is especially exacerbated in non-profit hospitals, areas with health care shortages, and in certain counties. Counties facing the most burden that is increasing include Los Angeles, San Bernardino, San Diego, Alameda, Santa Clara, San Joaquin, Fresno, Kern, Sacramento, Monterey, Ventura, Sonoma, and Contra Costa.

* Insights and recommendations:
  * **Burden Trends**: Analysis of burden and its change by year, understanding the relationship between burden and hospital ownership, health care resources, and diagnoses
  * **Burden by Disease**: Assessment of diseases and their corresponding burden to health care systems
  * **Regional Strain**: Evaluation of county burden and yearly change, while flagging regional hotspots
  * **Hospital Comparisons**: Comparing ER burden with focus on hospitals that are repeatedly burdened in subsequent years
